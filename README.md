Greensearch
===========

### What is it?

Green search allows users to find plants based on qualitative descriptions.

For example, when you see a five-pointed leaves and dark-green leaf, and you have no idea what it is, you start typing what you see. The results are displayed, allowing you to narrow your choices.

### Gems

* Devise for authentication (so that we can later build things like bookmarking for user).
* [Will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) - seems like it will have some basic functionality that we may want in displaying search results.
